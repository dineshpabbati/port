Flex Appeal serves as a comprehensive fitness tracking solution, offering users a centralized platform to monitor various aspects of their daily health routine, including food intake, water consumption, exercise, sleep, and other active activities. Users can easily track and analyze their progress over time.

The development of this application will prioritize a responsive user interface designed with SASS. The application will utilize ReactJS for dynamic front-end interactions and will be supported by a scalable NodeJS backend. The backend employs ExpressJS middleware to efficiently route requests to the relevant business logic functions, ensuring a seamless and effective user experience.
